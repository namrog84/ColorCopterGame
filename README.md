This was intended to be a miniature game to 'warm up' on gamedev since I haven't done anything in over 6+ months.


Things warmed up/learned/used


Parallax Scrolling
-Simplex noise background infinite generation

ParticleEffect and Particle Generation
-wind and coins

SoundFXs

Used a pseudo walking path algorithm to generate random level based upon roughness and windy-ness

Fully utilized Box2D and LibGDX
-Box2D is used for all collision and movements
